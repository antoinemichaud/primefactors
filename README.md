PrimeFactors Kata
=================

#Rules

Your goal is to create the class PrimeFactors. PrimeFactors contains the `generate(int)` static method. This method is responsible
 for giving prime factors of the integer passed in parameter. You will aim to build it following the TDD principle.

NB : remember that 1 is not a prime number, but 2 is.
